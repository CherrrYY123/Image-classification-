# Image-classification-

This repository provides a framework to load machine learning models in a singleton pattern and use them for predictions. The framework supports models like **Next Word Prediction** and **Image Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)**. It ensures that the model is loaded only once into memory, which optimizes performance for repeated predictions, especially in multi-threaded environments.

## Features

- **Singleton Model Loader:** Ensures the model is loaded only once, making it memory efficient and reducing loading times for multiple predictions.
- **Thread-Safety:** Uses Python's `threading.Lock` to safely load and access the model in multi-threaded applications.
- **Flexible Prediction Interface:** Can be used for any machine learning model that implements a `predict` method, such as models for text prediction or image classification.

## Supported Models

- **Next Word Prediction:** Typically involves natural language processing (NLP) models that predict the next word in a sentence. This framework can be extended to support these types of models.
- **Image Classification using SVM:** The framework can load and use image classification models trained with Support Vector Machines (SVM), typically for classifying images into different categories.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `numpy`: For numerical operations and reshaping input data.
- `scikit-learn`: For models like SVM and other machine learning tools.
- `pickle`: For loading serialized Python objects (model files).

### Installing Dependencies

Before running the code, install the necessary dependencies using `pip`
